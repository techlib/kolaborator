Dear Sir or Madam,

thank you for your report of suspicious activity that originated from our network.

Time of the incindent: $timestamp
IP address: $ip_address
Port: $port

We always try to investigate who is responsible for the reported activity and when we find out
we warn them that in case of reccuring violation we will be forced to terminate their membership.
If the traffic originated from eduroam network we try our best to notify their home institution of their aleged behaviour.

Unfortunatly in this case we couldn't find who was responsible for the reported behaviour,
either because we no longer have the data necessary to identify them (we store the data only for a limited time)
or because they accesed our network anonymously through temporary network during some public event (conference, etc.).

This is an automated message. If you want to contact us, please reply to this email.
