Dear Sir or Madam,

thank you for your report of suspicious activity that originated from our network.

Time of the incident: {timestamp}
IP address: {ip_address}
Port: {port}

We always try to investigate who is responsible for the reported incident and take a corrective action, but in this case we couldn't find the user responsible for the reported behaviour.

We either no longer have the data necessary to identify them (we store the data only for a limited time) or they have accessed our network anonymously (temporary conference network).

This is an automated message. If you wish to contact us, please reply to this email.
